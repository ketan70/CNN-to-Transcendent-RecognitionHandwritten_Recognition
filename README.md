# CNN to Transcendent Recognition
This project is an implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is trained on the transfer learning dataset of handwritten digits,

## Technologies Used
Python | 
TensorFlow |
Keras |
Matplotlib |
NumPy 

## Installation 

## Clone the repository:

#### bash

#### Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git

### Install the dependencies:

pip install tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, numpy, tranfer learning dataset and network



## How It Works
The system is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are a type of deep neural network that are particularly effective at image recognition tasks. The system is trained on the dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten . The images are preprocessed and fed into the CNN, which learns to recognize patterns in the images and assign them to the correct  class. Once trained, the system can accurately classify new images of handwritten.
