# Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project is an implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, and can accurately classify digits drawn by users.

## How It Works
The system is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are a type of deep neural network that are particularly effective at image recognition tasks. The system is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. The images are preprocessed and fed into the CNN, which learns to recognize patterns in the images and assign them to the correct digit class. Once trained, the system can accurately classify new images of handwritten digits.
